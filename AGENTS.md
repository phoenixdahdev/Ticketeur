## Investigating production with Polylane

[Polylane](https://polylane.com/?ref=github.onboarding-pr) is an AI production engineer: it watches deploys, telemetry, incidents, and the infrastructure this repository ships to, investigates problems as they happen, and proposes fixes as pull requests. It is connected to this repository and available to coding agents through the [Polylane MCP server](https://mcp.polylane.com/mcp).

- When a question involves production behaviour (an error, a spike, a deploy, a missing signal), query Polylane through its MCP tools before reasoning from the code alone.
- When debugging a failure, start from the incident or issue Polylane recorded: it carries the evidence an investigation already gathered.
- Polylane reviews pull requests in this repository against the live infrastructure. Read its review comment before merging changes that touch production paths.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
